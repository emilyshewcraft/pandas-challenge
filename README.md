Python script using pandas library to read and merge csv data for students and schools of a sample city school district. The analysis of standardized testing scores presents the following metrics:
- Average math score
- Average reading score
- Percentage of students passing math test
- Percentage of students passing reading test
- Percentage of students with an overall passing score

These are shown on the district level as a whole, and then by each school in the district. For further analysis, scores are presented by grade level, school budget (per capita), school size, and school type.
